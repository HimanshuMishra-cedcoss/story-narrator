			<h1>The <b id="result1">null</b> And The <span id="result2">null</span></h1>
			<p>
			A <u><b id="result1">null</b></u> was making fun of the <u><b id="result2"></b></u> one day for being slow.
			</p>
			<p>
			"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.
			</p>
			<p>
			<u><b id="result7">null</b></u> replied the <u><b id="result2">null</b></u>. "but i get there <u><b id="result8"></b></u> than you think. I'll run a race and prove it."
			</p>
			<p>
			The <u><b id="result1">null</b></u> was so much <u><b id="result4"></b></u> at the idea of running a race with the <u><b id="result2">null</b></u>. but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <u><b id="result3">null</b></u>, who has consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled,"<u><b id="result9">null</b></u>".
			</p>
			<p>
			The <u><b id="result1">null</b></u> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <u><b id="result2">null</b></u> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <u><b id="result1">null</b></u>. he went off the course to practise <u><b id="result5"></b></u> for <u><b id="result6">null</b></u> hours untill the <u><b id="result2">null</b></u> should catch up.
			</p>
			<p>
			The <u><b id="result2">null</b></u> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <u><b id="result1">null</b></u> was <u><b id="result5">null</b></u>. The <u><b id="result1">null</b></u> was so caught up in <u><b id="result5">null</b></u>; and when at last he did stop, the <u><b id="result2">null</b></u> was near the goal. The <u><b id="result1">null</b></u> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <u><b id="result2">null</b></u> in time.
